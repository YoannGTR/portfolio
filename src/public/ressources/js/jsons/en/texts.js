    "about": "Passionate about programming for more than 4 years, I trained myself thanks to OpenClassroom, then I joined a BUT Informatique after my general baccalaureate in 2022. I carried out numerous projects, whether personal or related to my studies, which gradually brought me to my current level. During these, I enjoyed overcoming the difficulties encountered, exploring many options and ensuring that the project was completely finished so that I could be proud of the result."
